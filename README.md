# My Personal Website
This is a project I created for the Girls Who Code Pathways Program. It includes a home page and a portfolio page. The home page includes a title, an image of me, a navigation bar, an About Me section, and a hobbies section. The portfolio page contains a navigation bar and a list of projects I have created. This website helped me expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS which I will use in future projects. It also gave me experience on creating websites for professional reasons as all my previous ones have been for fun. I used Visual Studio Code to count my time and moved over to Replit for submission. I used an external CSS file for both pages. In order to change the position of the nav bar on the portfolio page I added an ID. In fact, I used IDs and classes many times throughout both pages to do things such as centering and formatting an image gallery. I also used many div tags in order to format the images into rows and columms and to center the gallery. It was challenging to format the elements on the page so that they stayed centered even if the size of the viewport changed, but I was able to solve this issue by wrapping the image gallery in a div tag and changing the display style to grid. I also faced the issue of having readable text over images, and was able to solve this by making the opacity of the image change when you hover over it. In order to make this site more useful and engaging, I added links to the images of my projects so that they would be accessible for people to view. By creating this website, I learned how to use new tags such as transform, how to increase specificity in CSS, and how to add details to elements during different stages.

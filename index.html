    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      Hi! My name is Sai V. I am a sixteen year old high school senior from Florida and I want to pursue cybersecurity.
      I have taken many computer science classes in school and on my own time. I have also done summer programs
      and competitions. I enjoy solving logic problems and finding solutions because it makes me feel accomplished. 
      In my freetime, I read, binge TV shows, and learn to play instruments. Right now, I am learning piano and guitar. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made websites in the past but I am more interested in fields like cybersecurity because I can make systems
      safer for the public. I first learned about cybersecurity and cyberforensics through a TV show and was interested.
      I found out my middle school had a class that involved cybersecurity and was instantly hooked. I hope to continue my
      education in the field and make an impact on it.
    </p>
